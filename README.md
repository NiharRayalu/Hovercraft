# Hovercraft
<h3 align="center">A vehicle that can both run on land and water.</h3>

- Working:- **Hovercraft use blowers to produce a large volume of air below the hull, or air cushion, that is slightly above atmospheric pressure. The pressure difference between the higher-pressure air below the hull and lower pressure ambient air above it produces lift, which causes the hull to float above the running surface.**
